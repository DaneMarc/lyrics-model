14,"Adam Bede LyricsChurch ""HETTY, Hetty, don't you know church begins at two, and it's gone half after one a'ready? Have you got nothing better to think on this good Sunday as poor old Thias Bede's to be put into the ground, and him drownded i' th' dead o' the night, as it's enough to make one's back run cold, but you must be 'dizening yourself as if there was a wedding i'stid of a funeral?"" ""Well, Aunt,"" said Hetty, ""I can't be ready so soon as everybody else, when I've got Totty's things to put on. And I'd ever such work to make her stand still."" Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and shawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been made of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her hat was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her, except in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser was provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door, followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she trod on. And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyser's own hand, setting off the proportions of his leg. Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face, which was good humour itself as he said, ""Come, Hetty—come, little uns!"" and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway gate into the yard. The ""little uns"" addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven, in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small elephant is like a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and behind came patient Molly, whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard and over all the wet places on the road; for Totty, having speedily recovered from her threatened fever, had insisted on going to church to-day, and especially on wearing her red-and-black necklace outside her tippet. And there were many wet places for her to be carried over this afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the morning, though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery masses on the horizon. You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the farmyard. The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made only crooning subdued noises; the very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would have been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual. The sunshine seemed to call all things to rest and not to labour. It was asleep itself on the moss-grown cow-shed; on the group of white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked under their wings; on the old black sow stretched languidly on the straw, while her largest young one found an excellent spring-bed on his mother's fat ribs; on Alick, the shepherd, in his new smock-frock, taking an uneasy siesta, half-sitting, half-standing on the granary steps. Alick was of opinion that church, like other luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who had the weather and the ewes on his mind. ""Church! Nay—I'n gotten summat else to think on,"" was an answer which he often uttered in a tone of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel sure Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed going to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and ""Whissuntide."" But he had a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies, like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had leisure. ""There's Father a-standing at the yard-gate,"" said Martin Poyser. ""I reckon he wants to watch us down the field. It's wonderful what sight he has, and him turned seventy-five."" ""Ah, I often think it's wi' th' old folks as it is wi' the babbies,"" said Mrs. Poyser; ""they're satisfied wi' looking, no matter what they're looking at. It's God A'mighty's way o' quietening 'em, I reckon, afore they go to sleep."" Old Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching, and held it wide open, leaning on his stick—pleased to do this bit of work; for, like all old men whose life has been spent in labour, he liked to feel that he was still useful—that there was a better crop of onions in the garden because he was by at the sowing—and that the cows would be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon to look on. He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays, but not very regularly at other times; on wet Sundays, or whenever he had a touch of rheumatism, he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis instead. ""They'll ha' putten Thias Bede i' the ground afore ye get to the churchyard,"" he said, as his son came up. ""It 'ud ha' been better luck if they'd ha' buried him i' the forenoon when the rain was fallin'; there's no likelihoods of a drop now; an' the moon lies like a boat there, dost see? That's a sure sign o' fair weather—there's a many as is false but that's sure."" ""Aye, aye,"" said the son, ""I'm in hopes it'll hold up now."" ""Mind what the parson says, mind what the parson says, my lads,"" said Grandfather to the black-eyed youngsters in knee-breeches, conscious of a marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling, a little, secretly, during the sermon. ""Dood-bye, Dandad,"" said Totty. ""Me doin' to church. Me dot my neklace on. Dive me a peppermint."" Grandad, shaking with laughter at this ""deep little wench,"" slowly transferred his stick to his left hand, which held the gate open, and slowly thrust his finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had fixed her eyes with a confident look of expectation. And when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again, watching them across the lane along the Home Close, and through the far gate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge. For the hedgerows in those days shut out one's view, even on the better-managed farms; and this afternoon, the dog-roses were tossing out their pink wreaths, the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory, the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach, peeping high up out of a holly bush, and over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow across the path. There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let them pass: at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of cows standing one behind the other, extremely slow to understand that their large bodies might be in the way; at the far gate there was the mare holding her head over the bars, and beside her the liver-coloured foal with its head towards its mother's flank, apparently still much embarrassed by its own straddling existence. The way lay entirely through Mr. Poyser's own fields till they reached the main road leading to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on stock and their ""keep""—an exercise which strengthens her understanding so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most other subjects. ""There's that shorthorned Sally,"" she said, as they entered the Home Close, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud and looking at her with a sleepy eye. ""I begin to hate the sight o' the cow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid of her the better, for there's that little yallow cow as doesn't give half the milk, and yet I've twice as much butter from her."" ""Why, thee't not like the women in general,"" said Mr. Poyser; ""they like the shorthorns, as give such a lot o' milk. There's Chowne's wife wants him to buy no other sort."" ""What's it sinnify what Chowne's wife likes? A poor soft thing, wi' no more head-piece nor a sparrow. She'd take a big cullender to strain her lard wi', and then wonder as the scratchin's run through. I've seen enough of her to know as I'll niver take a servant from her house again—all hugger-mugger—and you'd niver know, when you went in, whether it was Monday or Friday, the wash draggin' on to th' end o' the week; and as for her cheese, I know well enough it rose like a loaf in a tin last year. And then she talks o' the weather bein' i' fault, as there's folks 'ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i' their boots."" ""Well, Chowne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if thee lik'st,"" said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wife's superior power of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days he had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of shorthorns. ""Aye, them as choose a soft for a wife may's well buy up the shorthorns, for if you get your head stuck in a bog, your legs may's well go after it. Eh! Talk o' legs, there's legs for you,"" Mrs. Poyser continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road was dry, toddled on in front of her father and mother. ""There's shapes! An' she's got such a long foot, she'll be her father's own child."" ""Aye, she'll be welly such a one as Hetty i' ten years' time, on'y she's got THY coloured eyes. I niver remember a blue eye i' my family; my mother had eyes as black as sloes, just like Hetty's."" ""The child 'ull be none the worse for having summat as isn't like Hetty. An' I'm none for having her so overpretty. Though for the matter o' that, there's people wi' light hair an' blue eyes as pretty as them wi' black. If Dinah had got a bit o' colour in her cheeks, an' didn't stick that Methodist cap on her head, enough to frighten the cows, folks 'ud think her as pretty as Hetty."" ""Nay, nay,"" said Mr. Poyser, with rather a contemptuous emphasis, ""thee dostna know the pints of a woman. The men 'ud niver run after Dinah as they would after Hetty."" ""What care I what the men 'ud run after? It's well seen what choice the most of 'em know how to make, by the poor draggle-tails o' wives you see, like bits o' gauze ribbin, good for nothing when the colour's gone."" ""Well, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice when I married thee,"" said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled little conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; ""and thee wast twice as buxom as Dinah ten year ago."" ""I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a house. There's Chowne's wife ugly enough to turn the milk an' save the rennet, but she'll niver save nothing any other way. But as for Dinah, poor child, she's niver likely to be buxom as long as she'll make her dinner o' cake and water, for the sake o' giving to them as want. She provoked me past bearing sometimes; and, as I told her, she went clean again' the Scriptur', for that says, 'Love your neighbour as yourself'; 'but,' I said, 'if you loved your neighbour no better nor you do yourself, Dinah, it's little enough you'd do for him. You'd be thinking he might do well enough on a half-empty stomach.' Eh, I wonder where she is this blessed Sunday! Sitting by that sick woman, I daresay, as she'd set her heart on going to all of a sudden."" ""Ah, it was a pity she should take such megrims into her head, when she might ha' stayed wi' us all summer, and eaten twice as much as she wanted, and it 'ud niver ha' been missed. She made no odds in th' house at all, for she sat as still at her sewing as a bird on the nest, and was uncommon nimble at running to fetch anything. If Hetty gets married, theed'st like to ha' Dinah wi' thee constant."" ""It's no use thinking o' that,"" said Mrs. Poyser. ""You might as well beckon to the flying swallow as ask Dinah to come an' live here comfortable, like other folks. If anything could turn her, I should ha' turned her, for I've talked to her for a hour on end, and scolded her too; for she's my own sister's child, and it behoves me to do what I can for her. But eh, poor thing, as soon as she'd said us 'good-bye' an' got into the cart, an' looked back at me with her pale face, as is welly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven, I begun to be frightened to think o' the set-downs I'd given her; for it comes over you sometimes as if she'd a way o' knowing the rights o' things more nor other folks have. But I'll niver give in as that's cause she's a Methodist, no more nor a white calf's white cause it eats out o' the same bucket wi' a black un."" ""Nay,"" said Mr. Poyser, with as near an approach to a snarl as his good-nature would allow; ""I'm no opinion o' the Methodists. It's on'y tradesfolks as turn Methodists; you nuver knew a farmer bitten wi' them maggots. There's maybe a workman now an' then, as isn't overclever at's work, takes to preachin' an' that, like Seth Bede. But you see Adam, as has got one o' the best head-pieces hereabout, knows better; he's a good Churchman, else I'd never encourage him for a sweetheart for Hetty."" ""Why, goodness me,"" said Mrs. Poyser, who had looked back while her husband was speaking, ""look where Molly is with them lads! They're the field's length behind us. How COULD you let 'em do so, Hetty? Anybody might as well set a pictur' to watch the children as you. Run back and tell 'em to come on."" Mr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field, so they set Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the true Loamshire stile, and awaited the loiterers Totty observing with complacency, ""Dey naughty, naughty boys—me dood."" The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with great excitement to Marty and Tommy, who saw a perpetual drama going on in the hedgerows, and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior Tommy. Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her ready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and said ""Lawks!"" whenever she was expected to wonder. Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting, ""We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!"" with the instinctive confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault. ""Ah,"" said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this pleasant surprise, ""that's a good lad; why, where is it?"" ""Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge. I saw it first, looking after the greenfinch, and she sat on th' nest."" ""You didn't frighten her, I hope,"" said the mother, ""else she'll forsake it."" ""No, I went away as still as still, and whispered to Molly—didn't I, Molly?"" ""Well, well, now come on,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""and walk before Father and Mother, and take your little sister by the hand. We must go straight on now. Good boys don't look after the birds of a Sunday."" ""But, Mother,"" said Marty, ""you said you'd give half-a-crown to find the speckled turkey's nest. Mayn't I have the half-crown put into my money-box?"" ""We'll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy."" The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at their eldest-born's acuteness; but on Tommy's round face there was a cloud. ""Mother,"" he said, half-crying, ""Marty's got ever so much more money in his box nor I've got in mine."" ""Munny, me want half-a-toun in my bots,"" said Totty. ""Hush, hush, hush,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""did ever anybody hear such naughty children? Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if they don't make haste and go on to church."" This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles, alias ""bullheads,"" which the lads looked at wistfully. The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no temptation would have induced him to carry on any field-work, however early in the morning, on a Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a pair of oxen ""sweltered"" while he was ploughing on Good Friday? That was a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and with wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would have nothing to do, since money got by such means would never prosper. ""It a'most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines so,"" he observed, as they passed through the ""Big Meadow."" ""But it's poor foolishness to think o' saving by going against your conscience. There's that Jim Wakefield, as they used to call 'Gentleman Wakefield,' used to do the same of a Sunday as o' weekdays, and took no heed to right or wrong, as if there was nayther God nor devil. An' what's he come to? Why, I saw him myself last market-day a-carrying a basket wi' oranges in't."" ""Ah, to be sure,"" said Mrs. Poyser, emphatically, ""you make but a poor trap to catch luck if you go and bait it wi' wickedness. The money as is got so's like to burn holes i' your pocket. I'd niver wish us to leave our lads a sixpence but what was got i' the rightful way. And as for the weather, there's One above makes it, and we must put up wi't: it's nothing of a plague to what the wenches are."" Notwithstanding the interruption in their walk, the excellent habit which Mrs. Poyser's clock had of taking time by the forelock had secured their arrival at the village while it was still a quarter to two, though almost every one who meant to go to church was already within the churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home were chiefly mothers, like Timothy's Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her baby and feeling as women feel in that position—that nothing else can be expected of them. It was not entirely to see Thias Bede's funeral that the people were standing about the churchyard so long before service began; that was their common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at once, and the farmers' wives talked in an undertone to each other, over the tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor's stuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as far preferable—about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to wages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to year, and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could see her—about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer, was giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible woman, and they were all sorry for HER, for she had very good kin. Meantime the men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature entrance—what could they do in church if they were there before service began?—and they did not conceive that any power in the universe could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about ""bus'ness."" Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the farmers; for Chad was accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he meant what was, after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who had horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where the burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the farm-labourers, made a group round it, and stood with their hats off, as fellow-mourners with the mother and sons. Others held a midway position, sometimes watching the group at the grave, sometimes listening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in a knot near the church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his family passed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitude—that is to say, with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business; curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands behind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk was in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased, and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church. They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine passed. Adam and Seth were coming next, with their mother between them; for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk, and was not yet ready to follow the rector into the vestry. But there was a pause before the three mourners came on: Lisbeth had turned round to look again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any day since her husband's death. Along with all her grief there was mixed an unusual sense of her own importance in having a ""burial,"" and in Mr. Irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods of their fellow-parishioners. The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr. Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste. But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth; the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every one must now enter and take his place. I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for anything except for the grey age of its oaken pews—great square pews mostly, ranged on each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed, from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass, and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk, grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior, and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats. And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew had handsome crimson cloth cushions; and, to close the vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth, embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia's own hand. But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on that simple congregation—on the hardy old men, with bent knees and shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and thatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of the stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers, with their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly farm-labourers' wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow, folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held books—why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a few ""good words"" by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing up—the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey pews, while good Bishop Ken's evening hymn was being sung to one of those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent too—all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery. I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his ample white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair thrown back, his rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and upper lip; for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul beams out. And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall. I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his family. And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances—she was absorbed in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church, for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself. That must be old Mr. Donnithorne—he always came first, the wrinkled small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia was passing, and though Hetty liked so much to look at her fashionable little coal-scuttle bonnet, with the wreath of small roses round it, she didn't mind it to-day. But there were no more curtsies—no, he was not come; she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the house-keeper's black bonnet and the lady's maid's beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydia's, and then the powdered heads of the butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look now—she might be mistaken—for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the chancel—there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The chill disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt herself turning pale, her lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what SHOULD she do? Everybody would know the reason; they would know she was crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful hothouse plant in his button-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was dreadfully long before the General Confession began, so that she could kneel down. Two great drops WOULD fall then, but no one saw them except good-natured Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her. Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church except faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hetty's nostrils. ""It donna smell,"" she whispered, thinking this was a great advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good without biting your nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this little flash of temper did what the salts could not have done—it roused her to wipe away the traces of her tears, and try with all her might not to shed any more. Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little nature: she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at, or pointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would have pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should know a secret she did not want them to know. What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn ""Absolution"" in her deaf ears, and through all the tones of petition that followed! Anger lay very close to disappointment, and soon won the victory over the conjectures her small ingenuity could devise to account for Arthur's absence on the supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her again. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because all the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even with a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches to herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain—she would like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so, as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees. But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to discern odours. But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village nooks in the kingdom—a reason of which I am sure you have not the slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses. The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the autumn boughs. This may seem a strange mode of speaking about the reading of a parish clerk—a man in rusty spectacles, with stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown. But that is Nature's way: she will allow a gentleman of splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and not give him the slightest hint of it; and takes care that some narrow-browed fellow, trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house, shall be as true to his intervals as a bird. Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and it was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from the desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death—not in his bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant—and now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure. Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang. The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words— Thou sweep'st us off as with a flood; We vanish hence like dreams— seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings. Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days while he was living. The more there was said about her husband, the more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was poor Lisbeth's blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed tears, and tried to recall, as he had done continually since his father's death, all that he had heard of the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and reconcilement; for was it not written in the very psalm they were singing that the Divine dealings were not measured and circumscribed by time? Adam had never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had known plenty of trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this was the first sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his father's hand before their parting, and say, ""Father, you know it was all right between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!"" Adam thought but little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had been in moments of humiliation, when he had held down his head before the rebukes of his son. When our indignation is borne in submissive silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as to our own generosity, if not justice; how much more when the object of our anger has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his face for the last time in the meekness of death! ""Ah! I was always too hard,"" Adam said to himself. ""It's a sore fault in me as I'm so hot and out o' patience with people when they do wrong, and my heart gets shut up against 'em, so as I can't bring myself to forgive 'em. I see clear enough there's more pride nor love in my soul, for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th' hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him. And there went plenty o' pride and temper to the strokes, as the devil WILL be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins. Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself. It's allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still, but the real tough job for me 'ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against my own pride. It seems to me now, if I was to find Father at home to-night, I should behave different; but there's no knowing—perhaps nothing 'ud be a lesson to us if it didn't come too late. It's well we should feel as life's a reckoning we can't make twice over; there's no real making amends in this world, any more nor you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right."" This was the key-note to which Adam's thoughts had perpetually returned since his father's death, and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference to Thias's funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, ""In the midst of life we are in death""—how the present moment is all we can call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family tenderness. All very old truths—but what we thought the oldest truth becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure its intensity by remembering the former dimness? Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime words, ""The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,"" seemed to blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the bonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon, the fathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk, their simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday every one was ready to receive a guest—it was the day when all must be in their best clothes and their best humour. Mr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they were waiting for Adam to come up, not being contented to go away without saying a kind word to the widow and her sons. ""Well, Mrs. Bede,"" said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, ""you must keep up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when they've lived to rear their children and see one another's hair grey."" ""Aye, aye,"" said Mr. Poyser; ""they wonna have long to wait for one another then, anyhow. And ye've got two o' the strapping'st sons i' th' country; and well you may, for I remember poor Thias as fine a broad-shouldered fellow as need to be; and as for you, Mrs. Bede, why you're straighter i' the back nor half the young women now."" ""Eh,"" said Lisbeth, ""it's poor luck for the platter to wear well when it's broke i' two. The sooner I'm laid under the thorn the better. I'm no good to nobody now."" Adam never took notice of his mother's little unjust plaints; but Seth said, ""Nay, Mother, thee mustna say so. Thy sons 'ull never get another mother."" ""That's true, lad, that's true,"" said Mr. Poyser; ""and it's wrong on us to give way to grief, Mrs. Bede; for it's like the children cryin' when the fathers and mothers take things from 'em. There's One above knows better nor us."" ""Ah,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""an' it's poor work allays settin' the dead above the livin'. We shall all on us be dead some time, I reckon—it 'ud be better if folks 'ud make much on us beforehand, i'stid o' beginnin' when we're gone. It's but little good you'll do a-watering the last year's crop."" ""Well, Adam,"" said Mr. Poyser, feeling that his wife's words were, as usual, rather incisive than soothing, and that it would be well to change the subject, ""you'll come and see us again now, I hope. I hanna had a talk with you this long while, and the missis here wants you to see what can be done with her best spinning-wheel, for it's got broke, and it'll be a nice job to mend it—there'll want a bit o' turning. You'll come as soon as you can now, will you?"" Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see where Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white hot-house plant, with a very long name—a Scotch name, she supposed, since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression on Hetty's face as she listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond of giving information. Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain limits is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble understanding—it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover, Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty that the ""lass was well enough,"" and that ""a man might do worse""; but on convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly. Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who ""knew his business"" and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in confidence to her husband, ""You're mighty fond o' Craig, but for my part, I think he's welly like a cock as thinks the sun's rose o' purpose to hear him crow."" For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener, and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself. He had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his head forward a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets. I think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch, and not his ""bringing up""; for except that he had a stronger burr in his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is Parisian. ""Well, Mr. Poyser,"" he said, before the good slow farmer had time to speak, ""ye'll not be carrying your hay to-morrow, I'm thinking. The glass sticks at 'change,' and ye may rely upo' my word as we'll ha' more downfall afore twenty-four hours is past. Ye see that darkish-blue cloud there upo' the 'rizon—ye know what I mean by the 'rizon, where the land and sky seems to meet?"" ""Aye, aye, I see the cloud,"" said Mr. Poyser, ""'rizon or no 'rizon. It's right o'er Mike Holdsworth's fallow, and a foul fallow it is."" ""Well, you mark my words, as that cloud 'ull spread o'er the sky pretty nigh as quick as you'd spread a tarpaulin over one o' your hay-ricks. It's a great thing to ha' studied the look o' the clouds. Lord bless you! Th' met'orological almanecks can learn me nothing, but there's a pretty sight o' things I could let THEM up to, if they'd just come to me. And how are you, Mrs. Poyser?—thinking o' getherin' the red currants soon, I reckon. You'd a deal better gether 'em afore they're o'erripe, wi' such weather as we've got to look forward to. How do ye do, Mistress Bede?"" Mr. Craig continued, without a pause, nodding by the way to Adam and Seth. ""I hope y' enjoyed them spinach and gooseberries as I sent Chester with th' other day. If ye want vegetables while ye're in trouble, ye know where to come to. It's well known I'm not giving other folks' things away, for when I've supplied the house, the garden s my own spekilation, and it isna every man th' old squire could get as 'ud be equil to the undertaking, let alone asking whether he'd be willing I've got to run my calkilation fine, I can tell you, to make sure o' getting back the money as I pay the squire. I should like to see some o' them fellows as make the almanecks looking as far before their noses as I've got to do every year as comes."" ""They look pretty fur, though,"" said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on one side and speaking in rather a subdued reverential tone. ""Why, what could come truer nor that pictur o' the cock wi' the big spurs, as has got its head knocked down wi' th' anchor, an' th' firin', an' the ships behind? Why, that pictur was made afore Christmas, and yit it's come as true as th' Bible. Why, th' cock's France, an' th' anchor's Nelson—an' they told us that beforehand."" ""Pee—ee-eh!"" said Mr. Craig. ""A man doesna want to see fur to know as th' English 'ull beat the French. Why, I know upo' good authority as it's a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high, an' they live upo' spoon-meat mostly. I knew a man as his father had a particular knowledge o' the French. I should like to know what them grasshoppers are to do against such fine fellows as our young Captain Arthur. Why, it 'ud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him; his arm's thicker nor a Frenchman's body, I'll be bound, for they pinch theirsells in wi' stays; and it's easy enough, for they've got nothing i' their insides."" ""Where IS the captain, as he wasna at church to-day?"" said Adam. ""I was talking to him o' Friday, and he said nothing about his going away."" ""Oh, he's only gone to Eagledale for a bit o' fishing; I reckon he'll be back again afore many days are o'er, for he's to be at all th' arranging and preparing o' things for the comin' o' age o' the 30th o' July. But he's fond o' getting away for a bit, now and then. Him and th' old squire fit one another like frost and flowers."" Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation, but the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say ""good-bye."" The gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if he had not accepted Mr. Poyser's invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and dislikes must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr. Craig had always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall Farm, and Mrs. Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had ""nothing to say again' him, on'y it was a pity he couldna be hatched o'er again, an' hatched different."" So Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound their way down to the valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory had taken the place of a long, long anxiety—where Adam would never have to ask again as he entered, ""Where's Father?"" And the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went back to the pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farm—all with quiet minds, except Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone, but was only the more puzzled and uneasy. For it appeared that his absence was quite voluntary; he need not have gone—he would not have gone if he had wanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her again if her Thursday night's vision was not to be fulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and doubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again, of meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with that eager yearning which one may call the ""growing pain"" of passion.Embed",1.0,1.0

In restless dreams I walk alone Narrow streets of cobble stone Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked night I saw Ten thousand people maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare disturb the sound of silence. ""Fool"" said I ""you do not know Silence like a cancer grows."" Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent rain-drops fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bow and prayed To the neon God they made And the sign flash out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said The words of the prophers are written the subway walls And tenement halls And whispered in the sounds of silence",1.0,0.0

I got it, I’ll take us wherever I’m a staple in the game, all my papers together And my life is on display like Truman They wanna pre the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner My exes made some of my favorite music I dated women from my favorite movies Karma's such a thing of beauty I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you If I was you, I wouldn't like me either",0.0,0.0

412,"Johnny Cash’s “American Recordings” LyricsChapter Seven – DeliaAt his best, Cash manipulated his cultural inheritance so it felt immediate—a kind of confession. Likewise, his finest personal numbers are animated by a spirit larger than any particular self, expanding those songs beyond the usual boundaries of self and public, spirit and self. In Cash’s strongest recordings, the voice comes on as more than a single personality’s self-expression; it sounds more like some buried address, a grand cavernous restless place consenting to song. More expansive than an individualized perspective, this plundering transcendence is Cash’s oddly singular possession The novelist Barry Hannah, when interviewing Cash for a feature in Spin shortly after the release of American Recordings, noted how its lead track and single, “Delia’s Gone,” was an especially vicious, -frightening number. “If you’re going to be a criminal, be a criminal,” Cash responded. “If you want to sing God’s praises, sing His Praises!” That’s one approach. “Avoid extremes,” Benjamin Franklin once wrote, prescribing a different path. “Forbear resenting -injuries as much as you think they deserve.” Cash bore a different credo. His impulses—like his injuries and grievances—existed in order to carry him, out beyond any middle ground of acceptable behavior. “Eat and carouse with Bacchus, or munch dry bread with Jesus,” D. H. Lawrence wrote in direct redress of Franklin, “but don’t sit down without one of the gods.” To court the attendance of the gods is not only to invite salvation and reconciliation to one’s feast but also plagues of terror and dissension. “Kill when you must, and be killed the same,” Lawrence also wrote, “the must coming from the gods inside you, or from the men in whom you recognize the Holy Ghost.” There is no point in resting at Cash’s intentions with “Delia’s Gone” or to merely parse the literal content of the lyrics in order to judge and admonish their excesses. It was forged in a fire larger than Cash’s own. But we can’t leave Cash’s life out of the calculation of our response either. As a late and inexplicable issue of the American folk tradition, “Delia’s Gone” is not a self-contained parcel of meanings to be stored and retrieved and closely read in isolation, in a kind of metaphysical autopsy. It is its own history and tributary, fed by sweat, piss, jizz and blood. The song channels forces grander than the possession of any earthly self and, before it can really be discussed, those forces have to be felt. This is how it appears to be with great art. We can begin to speak truthfully of it only once it has struck us dumb * * * The commingled blood of love and murder has darkened centuries of American song, of course, from “The Banks of the Ohio” to “Frankie and Johnny” to “Goodbye Earl.” A key gets slipped into such songs, unlocking questions of action and consequence. What are the acts one must mortgage with one’s own life? A girl is killed and tossed into the Ohio River because she will not marry; Johnny cheats on Frankie, so she shoots him, rooty-toot-toot, through the bedroom door; and because he pummels her into intensive care, Earl’s wife and her pal extract his life as payment. Each song leads its listener to a threshold that should not have been crossed, and that threshold is never the same. It is not just simple sensationalism or vicarious cruelty feeding interest in these songs, generation after generation; they are parables, set in common language. Fifty years ago, a group of Minneapolis street-corner troubadours, The Blenders, spelled it out for us: you can play around all you want with TNT, you can go grab a tiger by its tail, but you better not fuck around with love If Cash had not murdered Delia, he would have married her. As a vow with the eternal, either act would have sufficed. It is mind courting myth, seeking a sufficient measure, in love and in justice. The folk antihero Stagger Lee grew legendary, song-worthy, because he killed Billy Lyons for taking Lee’s hat off his head. What lent this murder a mythic weight was not the extinguishing of Lyons’ particular life for such paltry behavior; any other fool could have stumbled forward out of anonymity and stepped into Lyons’ shoes and the song would not have lost an ounce of significance. The song is notable, recurring, because of the murderous transaction that occurred as a result of the absolute value Stagger Lee placed on style. Lyons, playing the rube, found himself trapped in a web of correspondences he did not understand. A bait and switch occurred. He took a bad man’s Stetson hat without knowing what it meant. Taking my hat, Stagger Lee’s moral calculus concluded, is the same as putting a bullet hole in your guts. How was Lyons supposed to know that all of the pride and vanity a man normally places on the fidelity of his woman, that entire burden of identity, Stagger Lee had transferred to the pimpish arrangement of felt atop his head? In dealing with a song that moves through myth, literal truths can only get us inside its labyrinth of correspondences. We have to find our own way once we’re in there. “It’s not an anti-woman song,” Cash announced in concert. “It’s just an anti-Delia song.” Who was this Delia that he ended up crooning about, this lover he tied down in a parlor and filled up with lead? Was she the sensual embodiment of some spiritual fact? A temptress crouched on the lower throne of Cash’s psyche? A sound circling the earth? She was just a woman; trifling, low and mean. She was promiscuous. When Waylon Jennings sang about her, she was as mysterious as a house in New Orleans. She wanted to kill him, too. She gambled and cursed her man . In the Kingston Trio’s “One More Round,” Delia was a girl who had slipped out the back door and was headed now to marble town, laid low at some stranger’s hands. According to Johnny Western, Delia died immediately when her Tony shot her and then she bowed her head; they dressed her up in brown and let her settle back into the earth. Scores of twentieth century recordings describing young Delia’s murder exist, relics of an irretrievable, unshakable American past. For Blind Willie McTell, Delia was just one more citizen gone to the graveyard; her murderous lover was sentenced to stay in his prison cell until she came back to life She did not stay in the graveyard long. Delia migrated, in song, to the Bahamas sometime in the 1920s and then returned, in altered form, to America in the 1950s, in the recordings of Blind Blake Alphonso Harris, Harry Belafonte and others. The Delia that Cash knew, the one that he first sang about—not on American Recordings but on a record released thirty years earlier—was the Delia who emigrated back to America, not the Delia who was slain here. Cash cultivated the Bahamian strain of the Delia legend. In a certain sense, she was already a ghost when he met her On his initial recording of “Delia’s Gone” on The Sound of Johnny Cash, released in 1962, Cash played it straight, devoting more attention to the legal consequences of the crime than to the act itself. In the opening verses, the plot matches up with the later, more famous American Recordings version. But the last three verses of this earlier version move quickly away from the scene of the crime in order to focus on the killer’s sentencing. In these verses, the singer declares that he’s not going to reveal his verdict to the listener because, vaguely, he’s “got a brother in Memphis doing life or 99.” On the calypso version of “Delia’s Gone” recorded a decade earlier by Blind Blake, the song’s narrator presented a Tony who killed his Delia because of a wicked curse and who believed his sentence of sixty-four years was not so bad because his little brother was serving one that was worse, spanning nine hundred and ninety-nine years. Cash, lifting this version’s sentiment while also attempting to re-Americanize the song, inserted Memphis as a marginal coordinate for the tale, but produced a confused jumble in doing so. The song trots forward anyway, and Cash notes how he is haunted by Delia’s ghost, almost in afterthought. The last glimpse the song gives is of the singer busting rocks on a chain gang, hearing Delia’s name with the splitting of each stone, the song’s lone mythic resonance; the story ends and the singer does not find himself asking any questions, though the earth keeps repeating its one answer anyway, over and over again Replicating much of the lyrical content of Blind Blake’s decade-old import, which itself was a revision of a decades-old American ballad, Cash ended up not only re-Americanizing the song but also casting it in the first person, from the killer’s point of view, as a guiltless confession. In doing so, Cash also ended up retaining the distant, uninvested voice of a third-person reporter, even though he was now singing the song from the killer’s perspective. Delia is dead and her killer is punished, but no motives or even emotions seem to have occurred. In most non-Cashian versions of the Delia legend, the story has been told from a relatively objective point of view, as a kind of reportage; a Tony or a Coony or some other lover shoots Delia after a particular transgression, usually either cursing or cheating. On Blind Blake’s seminal version, for instance, the narrator presents the facts of the Delia case line by line, and is then joined by a chorale of men on the “Delia’s gone, one more round, Delia’s gone” refrain, a refrain absent from the pre-Bahamian, early American folk instantiations of the song Blind Blake’s version sounds like a party or tavern gathering, a community granting authority and witness to the account; a group of men have collected together, to share a local story. In this story, Delia’s killer gets arrested, and then is sentenced the next day. The listener realizes, as the story unfolds, that both Delia and Tony are now outside the geography of the song: one is in a prison cell drinking from a silver cup, the other is in the graveyard, never to get up. They can be described by the song but they do not contribute to it. It is neither Delia nor her killer who will persist after the song’s completion but rather the community from which they were extracted using many of the same words as Blind Blake, Cash tells a very different story. In his 1962 version, he is joined not by fellow storytellers but rather by the slick and deathless background singers of the period, who lend their studio-approved mmmmms and aaaaahhhs to the narration, softening the rawness of Cash’s voice. They join the refrain, not as co-owners of the story but as a sort of mindless aural gauze, seemingly unaware of the mayhem they are soundtracking. And it is unclear as to whom Cash and the background singers are addressing; fellow prisoners perhaps, or maybe Delia’s memory . No sense of community or collectivity is present in Cash’s song. In his first version, the song is simply the story of a domestic murder and its expected, corresponding punishment. One suspects the song would largely be forgotten, would deserve to be forgotten, if it were not the prelude to the late, acoustic, solitary version on *American Recordings* that brought Cash back into the national consciousness. His first version is a song without motive, emotion or cosmic consequence, a slice of representative sound from the period, but a bit hollow, a little overadorned * * * “Mine wasn’t soft-core, pop-psychology self-hatred,” Cash would write in his second autobiography, “it was a profound, violent, daily holocaust of revulsion and shame.” “Delia’s Gone” displays a violent and primary mechanism in Cash’s life, a violence of ancient pedigree and Old Testament reckoning, and is similarly the issue of a collective mindset—the American folk tradition—prepared to accept a world in which sons and daughters are punished for the sins of their forefathers, in which men and women are cut down for shadowy transgressions, because it recognizes that justice and retribution are forces larger than the life spans of the individual players involved. The playground of demons and angels, tyrants and totems, such a mindset assumes our lives are rarely our own. “See all men and women according to the Holy Ghost that is within them,” D. H. Lawrence wrote. “Never yield before the barren.” To such a mind, we each are unmoored in eternity, inside the half-known. The thread by which we are cradled—call it necessity or morality or love—is not to be corrupted; it is what holds us above an oblivious pool Fleeing the barren, Cash turned to unsuspected quarters for nourishment. Regardless of what the movies say, it was not just simple beneficence that led Cash to sing prisoner songs or to perform for actual convicts, singing them back home. When he played at places such as Folsom Prison and San Quentin, Cash’s songs tapped into the repressed and wicked impulses pulsing beneath violently composed behaviors. He appeared in these settings like he appears in the imagination, not just as a relief but as a furious revelation. Bob Johnston, Cash’s producer at the time, recalled the prison show that resulted in Live at San Quentin and the defiant, damning song that Cash wrote for the occasion: “San Quentin,” Cash slurred at the end of the song, “may you rot and burn in Hell.” He played it twice. “It was surprising,” Johnston told Michael Streissguth, “because Johnny said, ‘When I sang it again and all of a sudden I looked around and I knew that if I wanted to let those people go all I had to do was say ‘The time is now.’ And all of those prisoners would’ve broken.’” Performing with his wife and friends, Cash nearly orchestrated a massacre. On the second pass through “San Quentin,” the spooked guards began aiming their guns at the prisoners who were climbing onto the tables and threatening to riot, responding to Cash’s damnation of their prison. “All he had to do was say something,” Johnston recalled. “It would’ve been a huge riot, and Johnny and all his family would’ve been dead out there.” How did Cash regard the potential abyss that opened before him? Did he find himself repelled by its invitation? “I was tempted,” he told Johnston, afterwards. Songs like “Delia’s Gone” were not far from the strum of Cash’s own being. He had started playing San Quentin in the 1950s, when a young felon—one with a spider-web tattooed across his back because, as one of his wives would later put it, he felt trapped inside his own body—named Merle Haggard was among the incarcerated. “There was a connection there,” Haggard later said, remembering Cash’s performance, “an identification.” It was an identification not only with the contours and impulses of the criminal psyche but also with the pieties of the prisoner, of one who acutely knows the limits and capacities of the self After the resurrection of his career that the prison albums triggered, Cash met with Delia again, during the first season of his ABC television program. Introduced as that episode’s “love song,” Cash performed “Delia’s Gone” with a feral irreverence, his eyes flashing in delight when singing about shooting Delia and watching her die. In this performance, instead of the confused lines from the 1962 version about his prison sentence and a brother in Memphis, Cash inserted a familiar motive into the song. “I saw my backdoor open, ran and looked outside,” Cash sang. “I knew she was gone to meet him, durn her mangy hide.” Seven years after his initial attempt, at the height of his fame, Cash was beginning to veer his account of Delia toward the mix of video-game violence and bemused stoicism that would make his American Recordings version so -compelling. In this 1969 version, Cash’s killer formulated his own bizarro vocabulary , caricaturing his violence with one hand but chiseling out a killer’s condescension with the other; from a later perspective, this odd new lyric reads as a test run for the equally odd and ominous “sub-mo-chine” of Cash’s final version The humor was played too broadly on this earlier television performance, however, to have the violence register as immanent to our world—it sounds like a distant occurrence in some other, even more cartoonish world—though we do begin to sense the killer’s aloofness, his sadistic pose of claustrophobic self-regard. The killer gleam in Cash’s eyes is in fact the most chilling element of the performance, outstripping even his laconic vocals; it may have been the most authentic remnant of the Delia legend to attach itself to this, or any other, version Cash would endeavor. “A love song!” Cash called to the band at the end the song, still delighted * * * There had been an actual Delia Back before Cash was even plucked from whatever obscure fold in the cosmos and thrust onto the swampy Arkansas loam, back in the era of Frankie hunting down Johnny and the fiery death of Casey Jones—heralds of the oncoming age, feed for the folksy fables of unsuspecting generations—young Delia had lived. Afterwards, they would say that her murderer was as drunk as a lord when he walked in through the front door of the home of Willie and Emma West on Christmas Eve night in the black section of Savannah, Georgia in 1900. We do know that everyone was loaded, slumped around the piano, gathered and leaning into song. A new century hid before them. “When my eye-strings break in death,” they were singing, “when I soar to worlds unknown.” These were the words pouring forth from their chosen spiritual, “Rock of Ages.” Delia Green was also there in the stupor, bright as a berry in her brand new dress. “Let me hide myself in Thee,” they sang. Christmas was coming and Delia was fourteen years of age when her lover, also just fourteen, came slouching into the room with a gun in his hand For a century, only ballads told the tale. But ten years ago, acting on a tip that the actual Delia’s murder occurred in Savannah either in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, a University of Georgia professor named John Garst turned to newspaper records for a lead. To narrow his search, Garst first began skimming through documented versions of the song, scanning its endless variations, looking for clues that would date the original crime. In Chapman J. Milling’s 1937 article in Southern Folklore Quarterly, “Delia Holmes — a Neglected Negro Ballad,” Garst discovered the following verses:Nineteen hundred Nineteen hundred and one; Death of po’ Delia Has jes’ now begun Nineteen hundred Nineteen hundred and two; Death of po’ Delia Jes’ now come true Nineteen hundred Nineteen hundred and three All those darkies singin’ Nearer my God to Thee.Garst began looking through the microfilm archives of the Savannah newspapers for the year 1901, to see what the ballad’s darkies were singing about. Within a couple of hours he found reports from the trial of a Moses Houston, charged with killing a young Savannah girl named Delia. None of the early Delia variations pinned the murder on a Moses or Mose however—her killer was often some variation on the name Coony —so it was unclear whether the Delia that Moses Houston killed was the Delia of the ballads. Looking at papers from around the date of Houston’s accused crime, Garst eventually came across the -following headline:SHOT BECAUSE REJECTED –––––––––––– Fourteen-Year-Old Girl the Victim Of a Jealous Lover Delia Green, a colored girl 14 years old was shot last night about 12 o’clock by Coony Houston and will probably die from the wound . . . And so Garst found her. And what a strange artifact the newspaper evidence turns out to be; forensic residue of the American mythos, it is a headline right out of Harry Smith’s old, lethal America. The language is plain, perfunctory, flat and, in its own way, absolutely haunting, with a power derived not from syntax or insight but rather from the strange crossroads it has been fixed as, a kind of perpetual midnight. We can read it even now as though it is still happening. “Delia . . . was shot last night about 12 o’clock . . . and will probably die . . .” Within the world of these sentences, Delia has just been shot but she is not yet gone. In the ordinary language of this newspaper passage, one accesses a middle space between Delia’s complete anonymity prior to the shooting and her legendary afterlife following it. It’s like visiting the spot that songs come from * * * Bob Dylan put out a version of “Delia” a year -earlier than Cash did, on 1993’s World Gone Wrong. His Delia is a purer remainder of the American folk tradition, funneled from the work of Blind Willie McTell and Reverend Gary Davis. Dylan didn’t pick up the post-Bahamian strain but instead recovered the song’s earlier, plainer enchantments, staying truer to the song’s original context while also constricting its mythic afterlife. On World Gone Wrong, Delia’s killer expects to pay a fine for the shooting and to end his obligations there. Instead, the killer ends up disappearing into prison after his sentencing; he spends his days in obscurity, sipping stale water from a tin cup, never to be heard from again “Well,” as Blind Willie McTell remarked to himself about the killer on his version of the song, the one that Dylan built his own around, “that’s one more rounder gone.” Strangely enough, McTell’s phrase “one more rounder gone” itself came to be transformed, in an American-Bahamian game of Chinese whispers, into an aloof refrain: “one more round, Delia’s gone, one more round.” The process of transformation has been lost to time; all we have left is this inexplicable keepsake. A portion of the mystery of “Delia’s Gone” as we now know it, post-Cash, is the very peculiarity of that refrain. One more round of what? One more round of drinks. One more turn of fortune’s wheel. One more spin through the song’s morose particulars. Whenever one tries to crack open the refrain, it keeps revealing the same desolate theme: resignation, the very taste of fate. And when the song finishes, it seems we are left largely unsure as to what it is we are to be resigned. One more round of what, exactly? Don’t worry, the song offers in unkind assurance, whatever it is, it’ll be back again According to Teresa Goddu, it is nothing to be praised. For her, Cash’s version of “Delia’s Gone” slips easily into a damnable lineage of songs that “participate in the ritual misogyny of gothic bluegrass without being held accountable for it.” That is, by wrapping the killer’s violence in a wink, Goddu argues, such songs get to enjoy a hatred of women without owning up to it. In analyzing the vicious posture of “Delia’s Gone,” Goddu focuses in particular on the “one more round” refrain. “While Delia’s power is obvious from the many ‘rounds’ it takes to kill her,” Goddu writes, “the song nevertheless celebrates the man’s excessive violence .” In a certain sense, Goddu is correct. On Cash’s *American Recordings*, the brutality of Delia’s murder is handled with an -adolescent wink. Listening to the song, imagining ourselves being driven to sing it, we are unsure whether we are meant to spasm with laughter or disgust. The song puts the dead back into deadpan and then slips off into the uneasy silence from which it had been delivered * * * Coony Houston, Delia’s young murderer, considered his crime to be the product of adolescent rough-housing, an unfortunate consequence of puckish impertinence; like a jaywalker or careless driver—like Dylan’s pimp in primary colors—he was willing to pay a fine. His lawyer’s clemency petition on his behalf suggests that Houston was incapable of comprehending the enormity of his act:Petitioner further shows that he was just a mere child at the time when he got into bad company and so unfortunately committed the act that he now suffers for and that it was done by him not only accidentally, but when he was crazed by drink in boisterous company for the first time in his life and that the crowd he was with and in got him drunk . . . In his own view, Houston was merely a drunken, -boisterous child; he was the true victim of his crime According to the newspaper record, at the moment of Houston’s conviction and sentencing, he was quite deaf to the incurability of Delia’s silence. “I exhort you to be a man,” the judge remarked to Houston, “even in confinement, to repent of your past evil deeds and strive to earn the confidence and respect of those placed in authority over you.” The historian Sean Wilentz, glossing on Garst’s unpublished research, writes, “Coony did not cooperate. Gaily, he thanked the judge and pranced out of the courtroom in a bailiff’s custody, ‘calm and as debonair . . . as if the experience through which he had just passed was a matter of every day occurrence and of no particular importance.’” On his final recording of “Delia’s Gone,” Cash corrected even as he carried forward Houston’s childish impudence. In the world of American Recordings, Delia’s killer is both unrepentant and nameless. More importantly, he is continually hounded by Delia’s ghost. Supernatural reparations are at work, marking the song as the product of a mythic world, a world which is resolutely premodern—prior to monetary compensation, prior to rationalized law—in its bearing, if not its jurisdiction. The violence of Cash’s final “Delia’s Gone” is the violence of the sacred, governed by the offices of honor and retribution, not institutional sanction. From Cash’s point of view, fate had long ago knitted Delia and her killer together as an emblem, singular and contorted. To such a state of affairs the killer has always been resigned: to Delia’s low-down ways, to his inability to resist them, to the necessity of her murder, to the inevitable punishment his crime would call forth, to the long empty hallway of eternity they would together have to share. There is no sense that the killer or even Delia ever expected to live in any other kind of world. He kills Delia without ever expecting to get away with it. And even though he is jailed for the crime, we sense that he is beginning to understand that that is not nearly retribution enough, for even after his sentencing Delia still haunts his nights and his earthly bed Perhaps he is beginning to realize that the song itself is among his punishments, and that he will have to sing it forever . The listener might even start to hear Delia’s footsteps as she patters around his cell and climbs onto his bed, kneeling upon his chest and cajoling him to sing her song again. “Jailer, oh jailer,” the killer whispers to her, gently. “Jailer I can’t sleep.” As accepting of these twists of fate as her lover, Delia shows herself to be unmoved. Her nightly return to his cell is her renewal of their union . When she comes to him each night, what is the refrain of her final, recurring request? “‘Delia’s Gone,’” she demands. “One more round, ‘Delia’s Gone.’” * * * “It’s an old black tune,” Cash explained. “I just added Memphis, tying her in the chair, and the sub-machine gun.” Back on his 1962 recording, when he first adapted “Delia’s Gone” from its Bahamian afterlife in order to refashion it as a ballad of Americana, Cash had inserted an awkward line about a brother in Memphis. For his resurrection of Delia on American Recordings, Cash remade Memphis as the central locale of the song’s—and the album’s—inner geography. In the Cash mythos, going up to Memphis is the same as returning inward, to one’s unruly origins. Like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, Cash had marked himself early as an outsider to the Nashville mainstream because of his roots in the miscegenational Memphis muck, and Cash masterfully exploited this marking; it not only granted him the profile of a kind of wandering exile, a refugee from the dark end of the street, it also provided him with a point of origin he could continually return to, a spiritual birthplace that happened to coincide with a larger national fable If Memphis truly does show up in more songs than any other city, clearly it is not because of its architectural or communal triumphs. The city stands for a sound; not only the echoing sound of Elvis’ rockabilly yelp meeting Scottie Moore’s electric strut and Bill Black’s slapping bass, or of Jerry Lee Lewis’ pumping piano and cruel magnificence, or of Al Green’s Holy Ghost chasing falsetto, or of BB King’s greasy digits wrenching out notes of blue and wonder from his Lucille, or of the famous boom-chika-boom of Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two but of the singular possibility that these sounds, in unison, offer: the potential for lonesome weirdos to step out of the shadows and into a kind of redemption. We might label this sound as being, in miniature, the American dream itself, or just a decent way to kill some time, or perhaps both The sound belongs to Memphis, regardless. Cash’s first Americana album, Ride This Train, released in 1960, not long after he left Memphis’ Sun Records for Columbia, included the song “Going to Memphis,” dressing Cash in familiar dressing. A member of a chain gang, all he wants to do is break loose and get himself lost in Memphis’ “honky tonk roll.” Cash certainly jumped out as the bad seed he claimed to be in the song. “My brother was killed for a deed I did,” he sang, anticipating the jailed brother in Memphis of his first Delia version two years later, “but I disremember what.” As much as their unrepentant violence, it is the peculiar vocabulary choices of Cash’s killers that jump out: I disremember? Humming somewhere behind his original “Delia’s Gone,” Cash’s even earlier “I’m Going to Memphis” not only provides a key to Delia’s eventual geographic locale, but also to Cash’s peculiar notion of the murderous psyche, his tendency to link a giddily eccentric vocabulary—from “disremember” to “durn her mangy hide” to “sub-mo-chine”—with a willingness to step outside the regulatory norms of good behavior. Even in confessing to their own atrocities, such Cashian killers refuse to consent to the boundaries of propriety; this refusal, like their words and deeds, mark the men as those who would prance around their own murder trial, who would regard the death of others with a haughty shrug. “Well another boy is down, the shovel burned him out,” Cash’s Memphis-dreaming bad seed sings. “Let me stand on his body to see what the shouting’s about.” Cash’s Memphis is American music’s devilish Eden. Sin and redemption, transcendence and kitsch, God and Mammon: flipsides of the same record. It is everything Memphis dreams upon: bravado, swagger, danger, racial calamity and collusion, desperate pleas of faith. A place to be a criminal and to praise God both: this Memphis is a place that actually exists, but only in song, for maybe two or three minutes at a time. When Wyclef Jean covered “Delia’s Gone” at a Johnny Cash tribute show in 1999, he covered the *American Recordings* version, outfitted in cowboy hat and boots, black jeans and black western shirt. In addition to bringing an island lilt back to the song, Jean also—in Cash’s fashion—made one slightly colossal alteration to the story. “I went up to *Brooklyn*,” Jean sang, “and I found Delia there.” At that moment, when Brooklyn replaced Memphis, the live audience went a little nuts, recognizing Jean’s revision as a small but significant victory. Memphis can be found anywhere, Jean announced; its redemptions and damnations lurk together in the shadows at the edge of any town, any self. It is the outline of a truer geography lurking within an immediate terrain In his recent book *I Shot a Man in Reno*, Graeme Thomson points out that Cash’s “Folsom Prison Blues” is in fact a cartographical blunder, putting a man in a California prison for a crime committed in Nevada, with a Texas-bound train inexplicably rolling by. Thomson’s insight is very precisely beside the point. You could set these locations side by side, and add Memphis and New Orleans to the itinerary while you were at it, if you could only find the correct, mysterious train or lost highway or thrumming baritone that would link them all together. Cash’s songs exist not in a political or scientific but a mythic landscape, even though that landscape’s hills and gullies so often look like the real thing. If you want to find your angry muse, his songs tell us, you’ll have to go up to your Memphis first. You’ll have to cross a threshold. You can go by a fast train, the last train or by God’s train; you can travel by a heavenly aeroplane or by a stolen car. By pick or by sword, by prick or by milk, whatever means of transport you choose: in order to undertake the journey, all veils of familiarity must be rent. If you want to find the eternal, look for it underground, on a hangman’s scaffold or behind prison walls; it may even be waiting within your own parlor, ready to ambush. Looking back at his great *At Folsom Prison* toward the end of his life, Cash explained the process. “We are in the timeless now,” he wrote, recollecting that first step onto the Folsom stage. “There is no calendar inside the cafeteria today.” * * * As it is in so many fables, when Death steps into “Delia’s Gone” it is to take on the role of Ovid, metamorphic auteur: through her dying, Delia is transformed into every scrape of a branch, each cracking of the earth, all of the strange confetti of her killer’s fears and dreams. The final drama of the song is that Delia cannot be restrained, not even through death. Delia’s dying, her getting gone, only ends up tying her more permanently to her killer For Cash himself, death was a mythic event, another metamorphosis: ain’t no grave going to hold his body down. Its enormity was to be understood and embraced. To a modern consciousness, death is something unknown; taught to behave as though forever young, we regard our own death as either terrifying oblivion or an impossibility. The death of others is reduced even further; it is either simple information or a platform for mindless sentiment. Turning away from these barren arrangements, Cash and Delia have come to be reflections for one another: death is the role for which they both were born, both only fully assumed their dominion once they shrugged off their corporeal dressing and slipped into memory. Both were finally transformed completely into song If Cash had truly wanted to tap into the emergent gangsta rap mythos of the early 1990s in order, as some commentators have claimed, to resurface his brand with a more marketable, gore-ridden shine, he would have dressed as a Stagger Lee and clothed himself in that ballad’s particular dream of self-possession, where swagger and style are companion enough. He would have left Delia alone. But Cash’s “Delia’s Gone” is not a song of freedom but rather a lament, one that harrows intimacy, all its debts and wages. Back in Blind Willie McTell’s version of “Delia,” her killer straight up asked the judge what the fuss was about, and his incomprehension, as much as his brutality, was the song’s occasion. A slow learner, by the time of Cash’s final version, the killer finally knows the fuss all too well. Despite Teresa Goddu’s implications otherwise, Cash does not simply butcher Delia and then laugh at her in his final version of the song. Rather, he opens a window onto the world of Delia’s butchering, where death is lightly regarded; he then opens a second window, onto a world where supernatural measures allow justice, finally, to be done The invitation is to linger and ponder the stereoscopic view. Through “Delia’s Gone,” both the power and the necessity of myth are made palpable: Delia’s eternal return attests to the power of myth even as the horridly plain details of her actual death suggest the lack that calls forth a mythic imagination. Even in Teresa Goddu’s critique of Cash’s supposed misogyny, a supernatural sensibility slips into the writing, like a cat slipping through a half-closed door. “he song nevertheless celebrates the man’s excessive violence,” wrote Goddu, adding parenthetically, “he kills her twice with a submachine gun.” Cash kills her twice. What ghoulish, gothic wonderment Goddu’s phrase suggests. Delia is killed and then resurrected so she can be killed again. One can rather easily dismiss Goddu’s narrow, unhistorical reading of the “one more round” refrain—as if the song’s refrain floated solitarily within the boundaries of this one particular version of the Delia tale, untouched by its own genealogy—but one cannot dismiss how Delia’s otherworldly prowess seeps into Goddu’s prose. He kills her twice. With a slip of the keyboard, Goddu provides the same uncanny testimony as Cash, illustrating just how it is one may channel forces more powerful, malignant and strange than one’s intentions or philosophies may suspect * * * According to the court records discovered by John Garst, Moses “Coony” Houston shot Delia Green because he grew angry at her when she called him a son of a bitch. Shown unexpected clemency by the judge, Houston was paroled by the time he was twenty-six years of age. There is reason to believe he fled to New York City upon his release Through the ballad registered in Delia’s name, Cash lets us in on an open secret, one that he and Delia learned long, long ago: the world is not on our side. Acknowledging this, one is forced to turn elsewhere—to fate or bad luck, to songs or to gods—for justice. “Not peace but a sword,” wrote Norman O. Brown. “Peace lies in finding the true war.” One must not only hope that Moses Houston was confronted with Delia’s song at every other city street corner, or that he grew to be haunted by her name, or that somewhere in the New York City darkness fate fit him to wear the other mask of violence, or that he felt at his own cruel expiration a familiar sensation of distant disregard. One must break into the world in which such justice can only be soYou might also likeEmbed",0.0,0.0

I told her Nina, the prettiest name that I could think of For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen I was nineteen, took me two felonies to see the trap, this crooked ass system set for me And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me I'm living fast, but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catching up to me And if my past becomes the death of me, I hope you understand For your eyes do you understand For your eyes do you understand me For your eyes do you understand For your eyes do you understand me For your eyes do you understand For your eyes do you understand me For your eyes do you understand For your eyes do you understand me It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout Was it the young *****s, blasting frustrated cause the cash running out *****s don't know how to act in a drought See baby girl I realized, my definition of a real ***** was skewed My views misshaped by new mixtapes That confirmed the *****t I learned in the streets was true That real *****s don't speak when they beef with you They just pull up on your street, let the heat at you And if a real ***** hungry he gon' eat your food I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you I pray you find a ***** with goals and point of views Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops And the cyclical nature of doing time continues My worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news I got the strangest feeling your Daddy gonna lose his life soon And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true But maybe there's a chance that it's not And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels And I can teach you this in person like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you For your eyes only For your eyes For your eyes only For your eyes For your eyes only For your eyes do you understand One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling He said ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing When times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me I dealt with the repercussions of my actions I know you tried to steer me 'way from that *****t But that *****t was in my blood, you know my life I know your Momma *****, send my love In case I never get a chance to speak again I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib That's the way I wished my family lived But my granny crib was in the 'jects I had to interject like, ""***** what you talking 'bout? ***** is you getting at?""

486,"Love Yourself Lyrics For all the times that you rained on my parade And all the clubs you get in using my name You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't, but you still hit my phone up And baby, I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself But when you told me that you hated my friends The only problem was with you and not them And every time you told me my opinion was wrong And tried to make me forget where I came from And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't, but you still hit my phone up And baby, I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that You might also like My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself For all the times that you made me feel small I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all I never felt so low and I was vulnerable Was I a fool to let you break down my walls? 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself151Embed",0.0,1.0

When we're skating in the park, If the storm cloud paints it dark, Then your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way.
